		<hours><![CDATA["I really like Hogans because, and this may take some explaining, it's really easy to use. What I mean by that is that this pub operates completely without hassle. The furniture is of the really simple, no frills, "place ass here" school and I think that has an effect on everyones mood. It's a good old school style that encourages conversation, a very positive feature in any pub." - Courtesy of Yelp.ie]]></hours>

		<hours><![CDATA["What are the unique qualities that make this particular establishment so appealing, you ask? Well, it's bar has a brass rail (VERY important, if you have ask why, well there's no use explaining it to you). There's trad music every night, they do a lovely carvery at a reasonable price and, probably most importantly for me personally, they sell Beamish. Added to this, the pub was built when pubs were laid out like proper pubs: lots of walls and little snug corners to hide away in." Courtesy of Yelp.ie]]></hours>

They swing about each other in small concentric circles and it has been said that the place can be slightly off putting to new comers not familiar with the often stand off-ish cliques."
